Takamatsu Park (Japan),
A visit to Takamatsu Park would not be complete,
without taking a relaxing stroll on one of its many paths.,
The path around the lake which is roughly 1.4 kilometers is,
popular with runners. On a clear day look for Mt. Iwate looming,
in the background. When in season the pink cherry blossoms,
make a picturesque contrast to the snow-capped mountain.,
